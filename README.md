# DEI-NameAnalysis

This GitHub repository contains a Flask web application for testing an LSTM-based model, which I trained on the Florida voter registration datasets from 2017 and 2022 using Google Colab. The application offers a convenient interface for predicting demographics, including race or ethnicity, based on names. It's a practical tool for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) analysis and research.
